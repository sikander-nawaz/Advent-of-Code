Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository. Here, I will upload my daily solutions for the challenges in **Python** as I work through this exciting coding event.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge event that takes place during December. Every day, a new puzzle is released, encouraging programmers to solve interesting problems, improve their skills, and have fun during the holiday season.

You can learn more about it [here](https://adventofcode.com/).
